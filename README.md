Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration Using Jupyter Notebook &  hawaii.sqlite 
1-Precipitation Analysis
-To calculate the Precipitation Analysis for a given year.
-Bar Graph shows the precipitation data based on date

2-Station Analysis
-Calculates the total number of stations.
-Calculates the total number of active stations.

Step 2 - Climate App Using Flask API

1-list of dates and precipitation value (All Dates)
2-list of stations from the dataset (All Stations)
3-ist of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year (All Temperature Observations)
4-ist of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start (start: 2017-01-01)
5-list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range (start: 2017-01-01 - end: 2017-01-07)
